# Easy server-side authentication with Flybase and Passport

## Introduction

Just because sometimes server-side auth is handy to have, we have to show how to use Flybase and Passport together in a node application.

Currently, we show how to use `passport-local` but we plan to include support for Google, Facebook, Twitter and Github in future versions.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/flybaseio/flybase-passport
npm install
```

Open `index.js` and add your [Flybase](https://flybase.io) credentials.

```
node index.js
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080` and try it out.
